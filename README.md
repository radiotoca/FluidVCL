# FluidVCL

![FluidVCL Components Showcase](./img/FluidVCL.png)

FluidVCL is a modern, high-performance set of VCL components for Delphi 10.x and above. Built with Windows GDI+, it brings a contemporary, fluid aesthetic to classic desktop applications—featuring anti-aliased rounded corners, smooth state transitions, and deeply customizable layouts.

Designed for developers who love native Windows apps but want visuals that feel current, FluidVCL focuses on performance, clarity, and control rather than heavy external frameworks.
